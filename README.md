# Sentiments_Analysis_APP
<p>Understanding Human sentiments using AI based text analysis techniques</p>
<p>In this project of sentiments analysis, we have made use of a Machine Learning technique called Natural Language Technique. We have scrapped the reviews from an online shopping website by making use of the automation tool of Selenium. All those scrapped reviews are then stored into a database. We also created a dashboard with the help of the dash library and displayed the pie chart of the reviews and also predicted whether the review is positive or negative</p>
